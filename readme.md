# Deno Stuff

Finally tried to try Deno, so i will keep this code base for reference for
future projects.

This one will probably contain full authentication/authorization logic with Oak
and some ORM, probably oAuth in future, to test stuff out. Might even work as
portfolio project.

_I wish someone explained the incomprehensible horrors of integrating prisma
with deno before i attempted to do it alone..._
